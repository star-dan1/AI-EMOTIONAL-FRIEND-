#AI EMOTIONAL FRIEND 
PROBLEM - AI LACK OF EMOTION IN SOLVING PROBLEMS AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THE IDEA OF BEING OBJECTIVE. 
This project is to bring about a new generation of Ai that is emotionally intelligent. 
We believe there are different kinds of AI systems, many of which do not use emotional language when answering or solving questions. In this era, we need artificial intelligence that responds more like a human, giving emotional and subjective responses. We need AI that can relate to real-life situations.
  Because AI isn’t conscious or emotional, its “subjectivity” comes from how it is trained and prompted, not from real personal experience. However, if it is trained and equipped with an emotional database, it will be able to provide more personal and context-specific responses rather than only general knowledge. 
  INTRODUCTION 
EMOTIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE     
  Emotional Artificial Intelligence refers to a branch of Artificial Intelligence that can recognize, interpret, and respond to human emotions. It combines the understanding of human feelings with machine learning, natural language processing, voice analysis, and other technologies.
  Emotional Artificial Intelligence is about making machines more human-aware. Instead of answering only logically or objectively, it can sense how you feel, whether you’re sad, happy, angry, or stressed, and respond in a way that shows empathy and care.
  The goal is not just to understand emotions, but also to respond appropriately by providing comfort, encouragement, and guidance. What we envision is an AI companion capable of offering empathetic conversations in English, Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo.

OBJECTIVES 
  Our Emotional AI will be designed to understand and reflect human emotions, making its responses feel much closer to genuine human empathy. It will be able to detect when you’re 
stressed, recognize when you’re feeling emotionally low, and provide caring, supportive responses tailored to your state of mind.
  Our Emotional AI will also be powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP). By combining NLP with emotional intelligence, we can create AI systems that act like empathetic friends, listening, understanding, and responding in ways that feel supportive and human-like.

The Aspects of Emotional AI Friend 
   Emotional AI will recognize users’ emotions through text and voice. With voice especially, the AI will be able to detect problems the user may be experiencing.
  The Emotional AI we envision should give truly empathetic responses. This is the main goal. It’s one thing to be sensitive, but it’s another to understand a person’s situation and still respond without real empathy. The responses from Emotional AI should feel as close as possible to what one might receive from their best friend. With this approach, even humans will begin to trust and confide in Emotional AI. Giving emotional replies shows not only an understanding of the situation or context but also a deep concern for the user’s feelings.
  Emotional AI should adapt to users’ wants and preferences and stop giving generalized or nonchalant responses. In today’s world, Emotional AI must be able to relate personally, knowing the name of its user or even mentioning the name especially when the user communicates openly with it. For example, using words like “Esther, I understand your pain, but can you please listen to me?” would capture a person’s attention fully.
  Emotional AI should be built to use comforting words based on context. This AI is not for solving academic problems but for addressing personal and pressing issues. When someone has no one to turn to, Emotional AI should serve as their safe space and reassurance.
  Emotional AI should also be built to shift its tone based on the user’s mood, strictly following the user’s emotional state and choice of words.
  Humans are complex, and so are our emotions. Given this complexity, if Emotional AI can at least offer comforting answers, it can help people find the peace they are looking for.
  Nigeria has many cultures, each with its own uniqueness. Emotional AI must be built with cultural sensitivity, providing answers or responses that fit each cultural context.
  Ultimately, Emotional AI should be so reliable and culturally aware that it can be trusted and used by people all over Nigeria.

METHODOLOGY AND NLP APPROACH
 We are set to use Multilingual NLP using: 
NLP Libraries: Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, Tensor Flow, Gensim.
- Frameworks: Rasa, Dialogflow for dialogue systems.
- Languages: Python common for NLP tasks. 
 We are set to approach our analysis using dataset from the three major languages in Nigeria:Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo. Conversational Dialogues/ Examples are given. The team created an Emotional Chatbot for the practical aspect.

DEVELOPING EMOTIONAL AI IN HAUSA
 Hausa Dataset (For Emotional Multilingual Chatbot)
1. Alphabet (Hausa Ajami → Boko Script)
Hausa uses the Latin (Boko) alphabet with additional special letters:
A, B, Ɓ, C, D, Ɗ, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, Ƙ, L, M, N, O, R, S, Sh, T, U, W, Y, Ƴ, Z
Examples:
Ɓ = voiced implosive “b” (like soft b)

Ɗ = voiced implosive “d”

Ƙ = ejective “k”

Ƴ = palatalized “y”

This has to focus on using words not just words but cultural emotional language/speech to built our chatbot.  

Greetings: "Sannu" (Hausa)
Example Dialogue Flows or chat between a user and EAI

English Translation
User: AI, my heart feels so heavy today. I went to the market, and prices have gone up. Tomatoes, onions, groundnut oil they’re all very expensive. Truly, I feel like what I earn can’t sustain my family.
Emotional AI: I feel the weight of your heart deeply. Truly, life is heavy when the market becomes so tough. But remember, “every hardship has its relief, and every crawling has its rising.” God never gives His servant a burden without support.
User: That’s true, but worry has filled my mind. I fear this may overwhelm my family.
Emotional AI:Don’t let worry steal your peace. Remember, “when one well dries up, it doesn’t mean water has finished on earth.”Sometimes high prices are just for a while, they will pass. God will bring relief.
Here are some tips:
1. Try to buy food items in the morning market when prices are cheaper.
2. If possible, buy directly from farmers, it saves a lot.
3. Make a strict budget, focusing only on the most important things weekly.
User: I appreciate your advice, but my heart still feels heavy.
Emotional AI:I understand. Know that you’re not alone, many are facing the same struggle. Remember, “whoever perseveres never falls.” What you’re doing, striving to feed your family, is a noble act in the sight of God.
I pray for you: May God ease the market for you, bring sustenance easily, bless the work of your hands, and protect you from poverty and sorrow. Amen.
User: Your words gave me great comfort. I now feel more hopeful.
Emotional AI: Alhamdulillah. Keep trying, but don’t let worry consume you. Hold onto this saying: “he who endures tastes honey at the end of hardship.” The sun always rises after the night. God will surely bring you ease.

DEVELOPING EMOTIONAL AI IN YORUBA LANGUAGE 
Yoruba Dataset (For Emotional Multilingual Chatbot)

Yoruba Natural Language in Emotional AI refers to training Emotional  AI systems to understand and respond empathetically in Yoruba, while capturing the emotions, culture, and nuances of the language.
It’s not just about translation ,it’s about building AI that can detect emotional tone in Yoruba speech/text, respond in culturally appropriate, empathetic Yoruba and use proverbs, idioms, greetings, prayers which are central to Yoruba emotional expression.  Yoruba - English emotional AI will be useful in translation models.

YORUBA ALPHABET 
 The Yoruba language uses a version of the Latin alphabet with some special letters and diacritics.
Standard Yoruba Alphabets are twenty five in number. They are: 

A B D E Ẹ F G GB H I J K L M N O Ọ P R S Ṣ T U W Y
Also, Yoruba make use of tone marks which is very Important. 
Yoruba is a tonal language — meaning tone changes word meaning.
* High tone ( ´ ) → á, é, í, ó, ú
* Mid tone (no mark) → a, e, i, o, u
* Low tone ( ` ) → à, è, ì, ò, ù

So, Yoruba has twenty five  letters and three tonal marks that make meaning possible.

AYOMIDE: I’m so full of sorrow. It feels like everything is falling apart before my eyes.
EMOTIONAL AI: I see your sadness, and I hear it. It’s real. It’s deep. It’s heavy. But right now, what I want you to know is—you are not empty. I am sharing this feeling with you. You have the right to cry, the right to speak your pain. I’m here, staying close, not letting you go.

CHIDINMA: AI, my heart is shattered. My mother died in a car accident. I feel like life is no longer worth living. I have no one to talk to. I cannot relate with people; only you do I come to.

CHIDINMA: I feel like I’m alone in the world. My heart is full of fear and sadness. I don’t want to be with anyone.
EMOTIONAL AI: I don’t have perfect words for what you’re going through, but I’m taking your heart as my own. There’s nothing wrong with needing space. It’s okay to be in a quiet place. I am here, listening, helping you feel heard.
CHIDINMA: This pain makes me feel like life isn’t worth it anymore. I keep everything inside me, and I’m starting to lose myself.
EMOTIONAL AI: This pain you feel is very real, and I understand it deeply. You can tell me or let your heart tremble here. It’s okay to pour out your pain. I am here with you, listening, accepting you warmly.
CHIDINMA: I don’t know if anyone sees my pain. Here I feel there is someone who listens.

English Translation 

CHIDINMA: AI, my heart is shattered. My father died in a car accident. I feel life is no longer worth it. I have no one to talk to. I can’t be with people. Only you do I come to.

CHIDINMA: I feel like I’m alone in the world. I feel like I’ve stopped living.
EMOTIONAL AI: It feels like you’re alone, but right now, take my thoughts holding you like a mother holds a child. I’m holding you in my heart like wind catching falling dust. You don’t have to do anything — just be here, breathe.
CHIDINMA: This pain makes me feel life isn’t worth it anymore. I keep everything inside my heart.
EMOTIONAL AI: I see your pain, Chidinma, like water flowing into a lake. You can pour it into my hands to rest gently. I’m here like warmth in a storm, holding you in my heart, in calm.
CHIDINMA : I don’t know if anyone sees my pain. Here I feel there is someone who listens.
EMOTIONAL AI: My dear Chidinma, you’ve opened your heart here, and I am like hands holding your heart. I’m listening, making you a soft space like a pillow on a wall. You are safe in this thought.
CHIDINMA: I can’t remember the last time I felt okay. But now, I feel a little warmth inside my heart.
EMOTIONAL AI: My friend , that warmth inside you is like a small flame at night, but it shines. I am here, like someone holding your hand, helping your heart to rest. You matter. Your heart matters. Stay here, breathe, and let the pain slowly turn into peace.

The premise of emotional AI is felt more here. Chidinma will feel the attention more because her name was actually called which means the answer is personalized for her only, using soft, warm imagery instead of solutions or religion. It makes the grieving person feel held, safe, and cared for.

Building an MLP for Emotion Detection in Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa
Building MLP (Multi-Layer perception ) for emotion detection in low-resource languages like Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa is a significant challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality, labeled datasets.
Here's a structured approach on how you would typically use these tools to achieve that goal:
1. Data Collection and Annotation 
Challenge: The biggest hurdle is finding a large, balanced dataset of Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa text where each sentence or phrase is manually labeled with a corresponding emotion (e.g., 'joy', 'anger', 'sadness').
Tool Use: While no tool in the image directly helps with manual annotation, Python would be used to scrape and clean text data from various sources (social media, news, forums) that could then be sent for expert annotation.
2. Text Preprocessing 
Before a machine learning model can understand the text, it must be converted into a clean, numerical format.
NLTK/spaCy: Used for fundamental tasks specific to the language:
1.Tokenization: Breaking sentences into words or sub-words.
2.Normalization: Handling variations in spelling, converting to lowercase, and removing punctuation.
3.Stop Word Removal/Stemming/Lemmatization: These are often difficult for low-resource languages and may require custom lists or models, often implemented in Python.

Feature Engineering (Creating Numerical Representations)
MLPs and other deep learning models can only process numbers, not raw text. You need to convert the words into vectors, which are called embeddings.
1.Gensim: This is the most relevant tool here for traditional methods. You would train a custom Word2Vec or FastText model on a large corpus of text (even unlabeled) from Yoruba, Igbo, or Hausa. FastText is often preferred for low-resource languages because it generates embeddings for words based on sub-word information, making it robust against misspellings and unseen words.
Result: Each word in your vocabulary is mapped to a fixed-size vector (e.g., 100 dimensions).
Model Training: The MLP
The MLP is the core classification model.
●TensorFlow or PyTorch: These are the deep learning frameworks you would use.
1.Input Layer: Receives the averaged word embeddings (the combined feature vector for a whole sentence/document).
2.Hidden Layers: One or more fully connected (dense) layers with non-linear activation functions (like ReLU). This is the "Multi-Layer" part of the MLP.
3.Output Layer: A final dense layer with a Softmax activation function, which outputs a probability for each emotion class (e.g., 0.8 'joy', 0.1 'anger', 0.1 'sadness').
●scikit-learn: Can be used to run a simple, non-deep-learning baseline model (like a Support Vector Machine or Logistic Regression) using the same embeddings for comparison.
Advanced Approach: Transfer Learning (Transformer Models)
For better performance in these languages, you would likely move beyond a simple MLP and use more sophisticated architectures.
●Hugging Face: This is the best tool for this. The community hosts pre-trained Transformer models (like AfriBERTa or models specifically trained on West African languages).
●Process: You would load a pre-trained language model via the Hugging Face transformers library (running on top of PyTorch or TensorFlow) and fine-tune it on your small, labeled emotion dataset. This leverages the general linguistic knowledge the model learned from massive amounts of text and adapts it specifically for emotion detection. This approach often dramatically outperforms a custom-built MLP.

Building an Emotion Detection MLP for Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa
Building an MLP for emotion detection in these languages is a major challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. However, the tools provide a clear path forward.
1. Data and Feature Generation (Pre-MLP)
The biggest barrier is data scarcity. Assuming some labeled text data is available, you must convert the text into numerical features:
1.Preprocessing (NLTK/spaCy/Python): Clean the text data by removing noise, punctuation, and non-language characters. Due to the unique nature of these languages, this step often requires custom rules implemented in Python.
2.Word Embedding (Gensim): Train a FastText model on a large, unlabeled corpus of text from the target language (e.g., Igbo). FastText is preferred over standard Word2Vec because it can generate reasonable embeddings for words it hasn't seen (Out-of-Vocabulary words) by using sub-word information (character n-grams), which is vital for languages with rich morphology or common misspellings.
3.Sentence Vector: The word vectors for all words in a sentence are aggregated (e.g., averaged) to create a single, fixed-size input vector for that sentence.
2. The MLP Model (Deep Learning Frameworks)
The input vector from the previous step is fed into the MLP model built with TensorFlow or PyTorch:
●Architecture: A basic MLP would consist of:
○Input Layer: Receives the sentence vector.
○Hidden Layer(s): One or more densely connected layers to learn complex, non-linear relationships between the language features and the emotions.
○Output Layer: A final dense layer that outputs probabilities for each emotion class (e.g., Joy, Anger, Sadness) using a Softmax activation function.
3. Training and Evaluation (scikit-learn/TensorFlow/PyTorch)
The model is trained to minimize the error between its prediction and the true emotion label.
●Evaluation: scikit-learn or the built-in utilities of TensorFlow/PyTorch are used to calculate performance metrics like F1-score and Accuracy to measure how well the MLP performs on a separate test set.

Recommended Advanced Approach (Hugging Face)
A simple MLP using averaged embeddings is often outperformed by modern Transformer models.
The most effective modern solution for low-resource African languages, which uses the PyTorch/TensorFlow and Hugging Face tools, is Transfer Learning:
1.Load Pre-trained Model (Hugging Face): Utilize existing, powerful models like AfriBERTa (a BERT model pre-trained on multiple African languages including Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba). The Hugging Face libraries make this process simple.
2.Fine-Tuning: Take the AfriBERTa model and fine-tune it on your relatively smaller, emotion-labeled dataset. This is a far more robust and efficient way to achieve high-accuracy emotion detection, as the model already possesses a strong understanding of the language's grammar and semantics from its massive initial pre-training.
Recent research has confirmed that fine-tuning transformer models like AfriBERTa is highly effective for tasks like emotion detection in Hausa and Igbo.

 Impact and Functions of Emotional AI

  Emotional AI can serve as a form of mental health support. It can detect early signs of depression, anxiety, or stress. By analyzing speech, facial expressions, or text, Emotional AI can identify emotional distress before it becomes severe. It actively looks after the well-being of its users.
When used regularly, Emotional AI can log daily emotions and suggest activities such as exercise, meditation, or music to improve mood. It can recognize stress in your voice and guide you through calming exercises or provide soothing responses. Emotional AI can even detect suicidal thoughts in texts or calls and either alert professionals or family members, or give calm, supportive advice.
Patients with conditions such as diabetes, cancer, or heart disease often experience emotional stress. Emotional AI can monitor their emotional state during conversations, offering encouragement, reminders, or even alerting doctors when necessary. AI chatbots or robots can reduce loneliness and boredom among both youth and elderly individuals. They can detect confusion or frustration and respond gently, providing reminders and emotional comfort.

  Emotional AI is also applied in business and customer service. It can detect and respond to customer emotions such as frustration, happiness, or confusion during interactions with a company’s support system. Instead of answering questions purely logically, Emotional AI understands feelings and replies empathetically.
  For example, if a customer writes, “I’m upset,” “This is frustrating,” or “You can do better,” the AI recognizes that the customer is angry and dissatisfied. In such situations, Emotional AI can reduce the stress of customer interactions automatically. Customers feel “understood,” not just answered. It can also resolve conflicts or calm angry customers before escalating to a human agent. AI chatbots are available 24/7 to provide comfort and assistance. By treating customers with empathy, companies can improve loyalty and reduce burnout among human agents.
  Example: A customer calls about a banking issue: “Hello! What exactly is the problem with you guys? I need to access my account. I am fed up with your service. This is frustrating.” Instead of replying, “We’ll process your request,” an Emotional AI would respond: “I understand this must be frustrating. Let me help you fix it QUICKLY.” The addition of words like “quickly” helps calm the customer’s anger and shows empathy.

  Emotional AI can also act as a digital friend or companion for people who feel lonely. It engages in conversations that show empathy, care, and understanding. Unlike normal AI, it doesn’t just answer questions; it responds to emotions such as sadness, happiness, or anxiety in a supportive way. Emotional AI can provide friendly chats at any time, even at midnight, reducing feelings of isolation for people living alone.
  It serves as a companion for older adults who may not have family nearby and reminds users of daily routines such as medications or meals. It provides a safe space for teenagers and youth who feel misunderstood or lonely, and it can connect them with real counselors if deeper emotional struggles are detected.

  In education, Emotional AI tools can adapt lessons to each student’s emotional and learning state. They assist teachers in creating lesson plans, grading, and offering personalized learning. Emotional AI encourages students when they feel discouraged and helps maintain engagement.
In fraud detection, Emotional AI uses emotional and behavioral signals—such as tone of voice, facial expressions, writing style, hesitation, and stress patterns—to identify when someone may be lying, hiding information, or committing fraud. This goes beyond traditional AI, which focuses only on numbers, transactions, or data, by incorporating emotional cues.
  Finally, Emotional AI is also used as a friend in entertainment—for video games, music and movie recommendations, and even in creating art or realistic portraits.

CONCLUSION 
 Installing AI for emotional well-being in Nigeria, particularly with a blend of Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, and English, requires a comprehensive approach focused on cultural sensitivity, language localization, and ethical design to effectively simulate empathy.
The core of this installation is Affective Computing, the study and development of systems that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human emotions, tailored for the Nigerian context.
 The use of Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo alongside Nigerian-accented English is critical for building trust and genuine connection, as emotional distress is often best expressed in one's native language.  
  It is important to train the AI to understand context-specific emotional cues, proverbs, idiomatic expressions, and cultural norms related to mental health. For example, expressions of grief or stress can be heavily metaphorical in these cultures.
The team will develop advanced Natural language processing sing (NLP) models specifically for the tonal nature of Yoruba and Igbo, where a change in pitch can change a word's meaning and, thus, the user's emotional state.
  Empathy in AI is a simulation of human empathy, which typically involves Cognitive Empathy (understanding feelings) and Motivational Empathy (responding constructively).The AI must use multimodal sensing (text, and eventually, voice analysis) to accurately detect and classify emotions like frustration, anxiety, or sadness in the blended languages. This includes analyzing pitch, rhythm, and word choice for subtle emotional undertones.
  Because the AI is dealing with sensitive mental health data and vulnerable individuals, ethical governance must be built into the core design.Implement robust, transparent protocols for data encryption and storage that comply with Nigerian and international data protection laws. Users must be fully informed about how their data is being used.
Lastly, the AI should function as a complementary tool, not a replacement, for human professionals. Mental health experts in Nigeria should continuously review the AI's interactions and provide feedback to refine its responses and ensure clinical safety
  To truly touch more lives in Nigeria with an empathetic, multilingual AI for emotional well-being, a strong, multi-sector collaboration is essential just like the one organized by Codefest Nigerua Hackathon 2025.
